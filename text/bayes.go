/*
Package text holds models which
make text classification easy. They
are regular models, but take strings
as arguments so you can feed in
documents rather than large,
hand-constructed word vectors. Although
models might represent the words as
these vectors, the munging of a
document is hidden from the user.

The simplest model, although suprisingly
effective, is Naive Bayes. If you
want to read more about the specific
model, check out the docs for the
NaiveBayes struct/model.

The following example is an online Naive
Bayes model used for sentiment analysis.

Example Online Naive Bayes Text Classifier (multiclass):

	// create the channel of data and errors
	stream := make(chan base.TextDatapoint, 100)
	errors := make(chan error)

	// make a new NaiveBayes model with
	// 2 classes expected (classes in
	// datapoints will now expect {0,1}.
	// in general, given n as the classes
	// variable, the model will expect
	// datapoint classes in {0,...,n-1})
	//
	// Note that the model is filtering
	// the text to omit anything except
	// words and numbers (and spaces
	// obviously)
	model := NewNaiveBayes(stream, 2, base.OnlyWordsAndNumbers)

	go model.OnlineLearn(errors)

	stream <- base.TextDatapoint{
		X: "I love the city",
		Y: 1,
	}

	stream <- base.TextDatapoint{
		X: "I hate Los Angeles",
		Y: 0,
	}

	stream <- base.TextDatapoint{
		X: "My mother is not a nice lady",
		Y: 0,
	}

	close(stream)

	for {
		err, more := <- errors
		if err != nil {
			fmt.Fprintf(b.Output, "Error passed: %v", err)
		} else {
			// training is done!
			break
		}
	}

	// now you can predict like normal
	class := model.Predict("My mother is in Los Angeles") // 0

/*
NaiveBayes is a general classification
model that calculates the probability
that a datapoint is part of a class
by using Bayes Rule:
	P(y|x) = P(x|y)*P(y)/P(x)
The unique part of this model is that
it assumes words are unrelated to
eachother. For example, the probability
of seeing the word 'penis' in spam emails
if you've already seen 'viagra' might be
different than if you hadn't seen it. The
model ignores this fact because the
computation of full Bayesian model would
take much longer, and would grow significantly
with each word you see.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_classifier
http://cs229.stanford.edu/notes/cs229-notes2.pdf

Based on Bayes Rule, we can easily calculate
the numerator (x | y is just the number of
times x is seen and the class=y, and P(y) is
just the number of times y=class / the number
of positive training examples/words.) The
denominator is also easy to calculate, but
if you recognize that it's just a constant
because it's just the probability of seeing
a certain document given the dataset we can
make the following transformation to be
able to classify without as much classification:
	Class(x) = argmax_c{P(y = c) * ∏P(x|y = c)}
And we can use logarithmic transformations to
make this calculation more computer-practical
(multiplying a bunch of probabilities on [0,1]
will always result in a very small number
which could easily underflow the float value):
	Class(x) = argmax_c{log(P(y = c)) + ΣP(x|y = c)}
Much better. That's our model!
